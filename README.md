Personal Data Broker (PDB) enables 21 network members to sell their personal data to third parties.  The personal data is always under the user's control and is only sold at terms and prices agreed to by the user.  At the user's discretion, the user may opt into the PDB aggregator, which distributes queries to all member nodes.
